2. Start and connect to your VM (let me know if you need help, have issues, etc.)
3. Once in the VM, Start Docker Desktop, please.

## Reset
When we start, I will review how to reset your code with mine if you need to.
We will also reset our database, etc.

## Today

- Review 
    - Services - Microservices - What's the difference?
        - Business Focused
        - "fits in your head"
        - Own state and state process (this is huge. stand by)
        - "Branch By Deployment"
            - In Git, we have branches. They represent parallel universes
            - In source code we can "branch by abstraction"
                - An `IDoImportantStuff` service can have one implementation one day, and a different one later.
            - With services, we can branch by "URI".
                - Allows us to evolve our solution over time without
                    having to evolve the entire thing.
    - [Data on the Inside vs. Data On the Outside](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3415014)

    - How to make them gooderer.
